Current Instructions for Building App:
Run, expo build:web, this makes the build directory that weâ€™ll end up deploying on to the server.
 
then in the terminal switch to the build directory
cd web-build
 
Then to run the build we use npx where the number after -l is the port you want the app to run on
npx serve -l 3211
 
Then we need to start our express server in a new terminal and that is done with,
node server.js
